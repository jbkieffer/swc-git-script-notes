These files represent the complete teaching notes and slides from this 3.5 hour lesson. The idea for presenting the lesson this way originated with [Mark Laufersweiler](https://github.com/laufers), University of Oklahoma Libraries. The lesson consists of:

- Bash Script material from [Software Carpentry Bash episode 6](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-script/index.html)
- Git and GitHub material from [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

Learners develop the Bash script and apply version control to it over the course of the workshop. The resulting number of commits is similar to the canonical [Version Control with Git lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). Although GitHub [collaboration](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/08-collab/index.html), [conflict](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/09-conflict/index.html), and [contribution](https://oulib-swc.github.io/git-novice-countries/08-collab/) are not covered in these notes, existing material could be adapted into this content to extend the lesson.

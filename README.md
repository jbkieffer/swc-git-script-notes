These files represent the complete teaching notes from this 3.5 hour lesson. The idea for presenting the lesson this way originated with [Mark Laufersweiler](https://github.com/laufers), University of Oklahoma Libraries. The lesson consists of:

- Bash Script material from [Software Carpentry Bash episode 6](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-script/index.html)
- Git and GitHub material from [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

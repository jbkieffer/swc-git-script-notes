In this section:
- Create a Git repository

DON'T FORGET TO ASK FOR QUESTIONS

*****************************************************
Now that Git is configured, let's make a repository to track our work in the molecules/ directory.

Confirm I'm in molecules - put up a green check when you confirm, too
>pwd

>git init (tells Git to initiate a repository for the molecules/ directory)

>ls (what happened? doesn't look like anything changed. Promise, something is there)
>ls -a (recall -a flag from last week)
See .git hidden directory - this is where Git stores information about the project. If this directory gets deleted, all our information about the project - history, commits, timestamps, everything - gets deleted too.

Depending on your command-line program (Terminal or GitBash), your prompt may have changed when you initiated the Git repository. It's trying to be helpful by telling you that there's a repository here, since you can't see any evidence unless you ls -a and look for the .git file.

Let's ask Git about the status of our project:
>git status (this is the first Git power command - will use this a lot)

Congrats, you have a local repo!

*****************************************************
KEY POINT
>git init creates a new repository (repo)

The information about this repository resides in the hidden .git directory
